# Project Overview
A CMS framework build on top of Laravel version 4.2. The main idea of this project is that providing same CMS flavor like as WordPress provides in his CMS but in sense of lighter way and more functional. In this CMS, I integrated a query base application where visitor could be login and could apply for their Entrepreneurship and from admin panel; admin could review this request and could be archived it for further processing.
